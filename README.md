## Summary
### Drawbacks
Although this page is functional with the filters, it isn't really pratical to type the exact name of the data you're looking for, it could be just type letters that matches that data instead of the whole data name.

### Recommendations
- Use a scroll down bar filter instead of typing the data, could be practical, as well the user may not know the whole dataset.
- Have a button that clears the filter options entered so the user don't spend time deleting option by option.
